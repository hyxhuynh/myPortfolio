            <p>
                I am a full stack developer that has skills in the front-end and back-end of web applications. I have a passion for problem solving and creative design. I worked on projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL/Sequalize, MongoDB/Mongoose, User Authentication with Passport.js and express-session, and REST API. I recently explore projects using C# and ASP.NET Core MVC with MySQL database as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background in Biology and previous career as a Chemist has sparked my interests in building meaningful programs that solves any complex real-world problems in the most accurate and efficient ways. While in university, I had written Python programs for biological processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation. I have since been continuing my learning journey and follow my passion in programing.
            </p>    

            <p>
                In the next phase of my career, I am looking to apply my development skills in projects to not only enhance user experience but also providing quality functionality.
